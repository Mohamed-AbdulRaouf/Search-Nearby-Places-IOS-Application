Search for places using MKLocalSearchRequest and display results with tableView

Apple provides a powerful native map API called MapKit. You can display a map, show the user’s current location, and drop annotation pins. And you don’t need to rely on any third-party SDKs.

For example, if you’re building an app that shows branch locations, displays geotagged content, or does anything involving a map, MapKit is the tool for you.

Maps contain a lot of information, so it’s natural for users to search for places. Just check out any popular app with a map like Yelp, Zillow, or Uber and you’ll see a search bar with a results table.
